Notes on one complex variable

These are my notes for the main theorems on one complex variable, that will be filled throughout the following years with interesting theorems, problems and techniques.

Note that most of the proofs are based on the ones given in many classical books, but I like to write them in a very concise (yet formal and not missing crucial steps), so this content is free to share.
